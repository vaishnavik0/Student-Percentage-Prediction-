Data Science and Business Analytics Task-1 (Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours) Using simple linear regression model

forecasting the marks of a student based on the numbers of hours studied per day

This is a simple linear regression task as it involves 2 variables
libraries imported : pandas , numpy , matplotlib.pyplot , seaborn
Database form : http://bit.ly/w-data
We have checked if there are any null values if not then we go to visualize our data 
from scatter plot we found that there is correlation between the 'Marks Percentage' and 'Hours Studied'
Regression Line plotted after that has confirmed that the variables are positively correlated.
After training and testing the model using regression function we finally predicted the percentage of marks 
Then by comparing the actual marks with the predicted ones the final result was:
According to the regression model if a student studies for 9.25 hours a day he/she is likely to score 93.89 marks.
